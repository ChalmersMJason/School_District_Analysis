# School_District_Analysis
Module 4 Python Pandas

## Overview
This analysis was performed for the school board to investigate evidence of academic dishonesty found in the data file 'students_complete.csv'. Suspicious data was found associated with Thomas High School. The purpose of this analysis is to remove the suspicious data and rerun a previous analysis to see how the results are impacted. The analysis will offer the school board key metrics on test scores & budget spending broken down by school and school type. 

## Resources
This analysis leveraged the following:
* Jupyter Notebook
* Python 3.7
* Data from the file 'students_complete.csv'
* Built on a former analysis performed in Module 4

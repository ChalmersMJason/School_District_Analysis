# School_District_Analysis
Module 4 Python Pandas

## Overview
This analysis was performed for the school board to investigate evidence of academic dishonesty found in the data file 'students_complete.csv'. Suspicious data was found associated with Thomas High School. The purpose of this analysis is to remove the suspicious data and rerun a previous analysis to see how the results are impacted. The analysis will offer the school board key metrics on test scores & budget spending broken down by school and school type. 

## Resources
This analysis leveraged the following:
* Jupyter Notebook
* Python 3.7
* Data from the file 'students_complete.csv'
* Built on a former analysis performed in Module 4

## Results
Adjusting the Thomas High School data had the following impact on the analysis:
* District Summary
  * Drove key metrics slightly lower as shown in images below. The following decreased:
  * Avg Math Score - down 0.1% 
  * % Passing Math - down 0.2%
  * % Passing Reading - down 0.3%
  * % Overall Passing - down 0.1%
  
* District Summary - Initial Data:

* Replacing the ninth graders' math and reading scores had little impact on Thomas High Schools' performance relative to the other schools. Even after changing the data, the overall passing % for Thomas High was still over 90% which ranks it as one of the top schools that data was collected for. 

# Impact on scores by various dimensions
